# Agile Self: Product Specification

## 1. Core Concept & Vision

**Agile Self** is a web application designed for personal self-retrospective. It adapts the agile KPTA framework into a simple, powerful tool for individuals to foster continuous self-improvement with AI-powered insights.

- **Name**: Agile Self
- **Tagline**: Your AI Growth Partner
- **Vision**: To create a private, intuitive space where users can reflect on their life weekly or monthly, identify patterns with AI assistance, and create concrete action plans for growth.
- **Motto**: Turn Reflection Into Action.

---

## 2. Product Features: The KPTA Framework + AI Insights

The product integrates the KPTA (Keep, Problem, Try, Action) framework with AI-powered insights for enhanced personal growth.

### Framework Components

- **Keep**: What went well? What positive habits or events should I continue?
- **Problem**: What obstacles or challenges did I face? What's holding me back?
- **Try**: Based on the 'Problems' and 'Keeps', what is a new approach I can experiment with?
- **Action**: Convert each 'Try' into a specific, concrete to-do item. This is the critical step that distinguishes our app from passive journaling. For example, a 'Try' to "be more organized" becomes an 'Action' to "spend 15 minutes every Sunday planning the week."

### AI-Powered Features

- **Wellbeing Score**: Intelligent scoring (0-100) based on sentiment analysis of your retrospectives
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify recurring themes in problems and keeps across multiple retrospectives
- **Personalized Insights**: AI-generated suggestions and observations about your growth journey
- **Trend Visualization**: Charts showing wellbeing score progression over time
- **Achievement Recognition**: Celebrate consistency and improvement milestones

## 5. AI Integration with Gemini API

The AI features are integrated from the start as a core differentiator and the primary driver for the premium tier.

### Technology
Gemini API powers the intelligent analysis and suggestion engine, called via Supabase Edge Functions for security.

### Functionality
The AI acts as a "Personal Growth Co-Pilot" by analyzing retrospective data:

- **Wellbeing Score Calculation**: Combines sentiment analysis with retrospective patterns to generate a 0-100 score
- **Recurring Theme Identification**: Uses NLP to find patterns (e.g., "Sleep issues appear frequently in your retrospectives")
- **Actionable Suggestions**: Based on detected patterns, suggests specific approaches (e.g., "Try the '2-Minute Rule' for procrastination")
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes emotional tone to track well-being trends over time
- **Achievement Detection**: Recognizes improvements and consistency to celebrate progress
- **Pattern Warnings**: Alerts users to concerning trends that need attention

### Free vs Premium

- **Free Tier**: Basic wellbeing score, limited AI insights (3 per month)
- **Premium Tier**: Full AI analysis, unlimited insights, advanced pattern detection, historical trend analysis

---

## 6. Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety and better DX
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling + shadcn/ui for pre-built components
- **Animation**: framer-motion for smooth, declarative animations
- **Charts**: Recharts for wellbeing trend visualization
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + auto-generated REST APIs + Edge Functions)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for relational KPTA data with AI analytics support
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password, social providers (Google), and magic links
- **AI Integration**: Gemini API called via Supabase Edge Functions for secure server-side processing
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended) or Netlify for automatic deployments from Git

---

## 7. Monetization Strategy

We will adopt a Freemium model to maximize user acquisition and create a clear upgrade path.

- **Free Tier (MVP)**: All core KPTA functionality will be free. This includes unlimited retrospectives, action tracking, and history. The goal is to get users to build the habit.
- **Premium Tier (Phase 2)**: The AI Co-Pilot features (thematic analysis, sentiment tracking, and personalized 'Try' suggestions) will be the core of the paid subscription plan.

    *,
    keeps(*),
    problems(*),
    tries(*),
    actions(*)
  `)
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
```

- **Empty states**: Friendly illustrations + helpful text prompting first action
- **Success feedback**: Toast notifications (sonner library) with success checkmarks
- **Animations**: framer-motion for page transitions and element reveals
  - `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}`
  - `animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}`
  - Duration: 0.3-0.6s with staggered delays for lists
- **Hover states**: Subtle color transitions and shadow increases
- **Focus states**: Ring utility from Tailwind for keyboard navigation

## 15. AI Integration Architecture

### 15.1 Data Collection Strategy

- Store full text of all KPTA entries (not just summaries) in PostgreSQL
- Tag entries with timestamps for temporal analysis
- Track retrospective frequency and consistency
- Monitor action completion rates per user
- Store AI-generated insights with cache timestamps

### 15.2 API Architecture

```
AI Integration via Supabase Edge Functions:
├── Gemini API Client (secure server-side calls)
├── Wellbeing Score Calculator
│   ├── Sentiment Analysis
│   ├── Keep/Problem Ratio Analysis
│   └── Action Engagement Scoring
├── Pattern Analysis Module
│   ├── Recurring Theme Detection
│   ├── Keyword Extraction
│   └── Consistency Tracking
├── Insight Generator
│   ├── Achievement Recognition
│   ├── Warning Detection
│   └── Actionable Suggestions
└── Rate Limiter & Cost Control
    ├── Usage Tracking per User
    ├── Cache Layer (Redis or Supabase)
    └── Premium Tier Limits
```

### 15.3 Premium Tier Implementation

- **Free Tier**:
  - Basic wellbeing score calculation
  - 3 AI insights per month
  - Limited historical analysis (last 4 retrospectives)
- **Premium Tier** ($9.99/month):
  - Unlimited AI insights
  - Full historical pattern analysis
  - Advanced trend predictions
  - Priority AI processing
  - Email summaries

### 15.4 Cost Management & Performance

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Free: 3 AI calls/month
  - Premium: 50 AI calls/month
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache AI insights for 7 days to reduce API costs
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple retrospectives in a single Gemini API call
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track Gemini API usage with alerts at $50, $100 thresholds
- **Optimization**: Use Gemini Flash for most analyses, Pro only for complex patterns

## 16. Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Firebase costs scaling** → Monitor usage, set budget alerts
- **Offline sync conflicts** → Implement last-write-wins with timestamp
- **Push notification delivery** → Track delivery rate, fallback to in-app

### Product Risks

- **Low engagement** → Weekly user interviews to refine UX
- **Poor retention** → A/B test reminder timing and copy
- **Complex UI** → User testing sessions before each release

### Business Risks

- **Slow growth** → Referral program, social sharing of milestones
- **Monetization** → Validate premium willingness-to-pay early (surveys)

## 18. Why Supabase for KPTA?

### Perfect Fit for KPTA Framework

**1. Relational Data Model**
- KPTA is inherently relational (Keeps → Tries → Actions)
- PostgreSQL enforces data integrity with foreign keys
- Easy to query relationships for analytics

**2. Powerful Querying for AI (Phase 2)**
```sql
-- Example: Find recurring problems across retrospectives
SELECT text, COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM problems
WHERE user_id = $1
GROUP BY text
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

**3. Full-Text Search**
- Built-in search across all retrospectives
- No additional service needed
- Fast and accurate

**4. Real-time Subscriptions (Optional)**
```javascript
// Listen for new action completions
supabase
  .from('actions')
  .on('UPDATE', payload => {
    console.log('Action completed!', payload)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

**5. Row-Level Security (RLS)**
- Database-level user isolation
- No user can access another user's data
- Enforced at PostgreSQL level, not just app level

**6. Developer Experience**
- Auto-generated TypeScript types from schema
- Instant REST API from table definitions
- Built-in auth with social providers
- Local development with Docker

**7. Cost & Scalability**
- Free tier: 500MB database, 50K MAU
- Predictable pricing as you scale
- No surprises like Firebase's document read costs

### Migration Path from Firebase (if needed)
If you later need Firebase features:
- Use both: Supabase for data, FCM for notifications
- Easy to add Firebase SDK alongside Supabase
- Not locked into either platform
